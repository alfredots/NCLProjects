PUC-Rio is located in Gavea, a charming neighborhood at the heart of the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, near the forest and the beach. It sits right at the edge of the Floresta Tijuca (a national forest), with a river extending from the forest through the entrance of PUC-Rio. Tree-covered mountains make up the north view of the campus.
A large number of city bus lines make it easy to get to the campus. It is close to Leblon, Ipanema, Jardim Botanico and Lagoa, which are wealthy neighborhoods in Rio.
